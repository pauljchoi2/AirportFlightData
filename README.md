# AirportFlightData
The purpose of this project is to learn about "big data" technologies and data science methods using flight data from airports across Canada collected via web scraping.<br />

## Phase1 (Data Collection):
There are now crawlers for websites of most Canadian airports. The script to run the crawlers is scheduled to run three times a day in a cloud through PythonAnywhere. The data is sent to a MongoDB repo in mlab.
The next steps here are to set up crawlers for aviation forecasts and collect metadata on stuff like which flights use which aircrafts. In phase 3, determine if weather or arrivals of aircraft impact departure times.

## Phase2 (Batch Processing):
Explore Hadoop and see how it can be used to facilitate data analysis. Outfit MongoDB repo with ElasticSearch.
 
## Phase3 (Analysis and Dissemination):
Assess which airline and airports have the best performance in terms of on-time departures and arrivals.
